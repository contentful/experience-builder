### BREAKING CHANGES

- Any existing experiences using the basic components will need to be updated. To
  do so, import and run the `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` method and
  run it early on in your application (before the first `ExperienceRoot` is
  rendered) like so:

```tsx
import { maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix } from '@contentful/experiences-sdk-react';
maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix();
```

This will register a set of the basic components with the older ids and allow
your experiences to continue to work. To migrate to the new components, replace
any of the components marked with "[OLD]" in the editor with their newer
counterparts (without the '[OLD]').

The `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` is meant to help older experiences
built on a early alpha release to migrate and will be removed in the next major
release.

- Any existing experiences that have a background image with a structural component will need to reset their image positioning values.
- for science
- Registered components will be wrapped with a div container by default. The `wrapComponent` option can be used when registering components to opt-out of this behavior if necessary.

- chore(release): updated release notes and package versions [ci skip]

* @contentful/experience-builder@3.0.0
* @contentful/experience-builder-types@2.0.0

- Registered components will be wrapped with a div container by default. The `wrapComponent` option can be used when registering components to opt-out of this behavior if necessary.
