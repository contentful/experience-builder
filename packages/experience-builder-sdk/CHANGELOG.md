## 2.0.0 (2025-03-21)

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES

- **experiences-sdk-react:** Any existing experiences using the basic components will need to be updated. To
  do so, import and run the `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` method and
  run it early on in your application (before the first `ExperienceRoot` is
  rendered) like so:

```tsx
import { maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix } from '@contentful/experiences-sdk-react';
maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix();
```

This will register a set of the basic components with the older ids and allow
your experiences to continue to work. To migrate to the new components, replace
any of the components marked with "[OLD]" in the editor with their newer
counterparts (without the '[OLD]').

The `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` is meant to help older experiences
built on a early alpha release to migrate and will be removed in the next major
release.

- Any existing experiences that have a background image with a structural component will need to reset their image positioning values.
- **experience-builder-sdk:** make returned experience reactive to props [] (#161)
- Registered components will be wrapped with a div container by default. The `wrapComponent` option can be used when registering components to opt-out of this behavior if necessary.

- feat!(components): image component and background image use ctfl asset api for optimized images ([dbcbac0](https://github.com/contentful/experience-builder/commit/dbcbac0f6e195a00206ec6a1eb94a2dc20af904a))

### Reverts

- Revert "fix: fetch all referenced entities (#507)" (#515) ([2b376f6](https://github.com/contentful/experience-builder/commit/2b376f6f1b6ab63e46c3f62affea0621af33e698)), closes [#507](https://github.com/contentful/experience-builder/issues/507) [#515](https://github.com/contentful/experience-builder/issues/515)

### BREAKING CHANGES

- Any existing experiences using the basic components will need to be updated. To
  do so, import and run the `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` method and
  run it early on in your application (before the first `ExperienceRoot` is
  rendered) like so:

```tsx
import { maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix } from '@contentful/experiences-sdk-react';
maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix();
```

This will register a set of the basic components with the older ids and allow
your experiences to continue to work. To migrate to the new components, replace
any of the components marked with "[OLD]" in the editor with their newer
counterparts (without the '[OLD]').

The `maintainBasicComponentIdsWithoutPrefix` is meant to help older experiences
built on a early alpha release to migrate and will be removed in the next major
release.

- Any existing experiences that have a background image with a structural component will need to reset their image positioning values.
- Registered components will be wrapped with a div container by default. The `wrapComponent` option can be used when registering components to opt-out of this behavior if necessary.
