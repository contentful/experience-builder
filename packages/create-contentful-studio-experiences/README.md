# create-contentful-studio-experiences

## Description

This package is a CLI tool to bootstrap a [React, Vite & TypeScript](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) app that renders [Studio Experiences](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/experiences/what-are-experiences/).

## Prerequisites

1. A Contentful Space that has Experiences Enabled. See: [How to enable Experiences in a space](https://www.contentful.com/help/enable-spaces-for-experiences/).
2. You must not have an Experiences Content type already configured for your space. For Studio Experiences to work correctly, a maximum of one experiences content type must be defined. As many individual experiences as required (within your subscription plan/billing) can be created.

## Getting started

```bash
npm init contentful-studio-experiences
cd <studio-experiences-react-app>
npm run dev
```

## CLI steps

1. Project Type - Currently supports React.
2. React Type - Currently supports Vite + React + TypeScript.
3. Installation Path - The generated project will be installed here.
4. _Optional_ Contentful Space - Note: only spaces that have already been "Experiences" enabled are eligible. See: [How to enable Experiences in a space](https://www.contentful.com/help/enable-spaces-for-experiences/).
    - Select your Contentful Organization.
    - Select or Create an CLI API Token.
5. Experience Content Type - Enter a name for your Experiences Content Type.
    - Creates your Experience Content Type.
    - Creates a Demo Experience Entry to help you get started.
6. Preview Environment - Configures the Content Preview Settings for Studio Experiences canvas to preview your local project.

## CLI Options

1. Dev - Argument that is likely only applicable if you are actively developing this package. If `--dev` argument is passed, some basic cleanup operations will occur after the bulk of the executable has be run, namely the auth token will be revoked if it was generated by the CLI in that run. Additionally, the react project that was bootstrapped during execution will be deleted.
    ```bash
    node dist/index.js --dev
    ```
2. Token - If you already have a valid API CLI token, you can optionally pass it as an argument. If you do not pass one, you will be prompted to create one at runtime.
    ```bash
    node dist/index.js --token <my_token>
    ```

## Environment Variables

The CLI tool automatically creates Vite environment variables for safely storing:

1. Contentful Space ID: `VITE_CTFL_SPACE_ID`
2. Contentful Environment ID: `VITE_CTFL_ENV_ID`
3. Contentful Experience Type ID: `VITE_CTFL_EXPERIENCE_TYPE_ID`
4. Contentful API Host: `VITE_CTFL_API_HOST`
5. Contentful Access Token: `VITE_CTFL_ACCESS_TOKEN`
6. Contentful Preview Token: `VITE_CTFL_PREVIEW_ACCESS_TOKEN`
