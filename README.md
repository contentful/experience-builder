# Welcome!

This repository represents a set of packages, related to the [Studio Experiences](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/experiences/what-are-experiences/) product.

## Documentation

Please refer to our [Documentation](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/experiences/) to learn more about it.

## Local Development

Each package has a 'dev' script that will build the application and watch for changes.

Run the following command in the directory of the package to start the dev script:

```bash
npm run dev 
```

## Troubleshooting

> [!WARNING]
> If your `build` command is stuck and not finishing, try resetting the cache via `npx nx reset`
